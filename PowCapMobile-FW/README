Using this firmware, Step 1:
Ensure that LUFA is properly installed and place firmware directory (PowCapMobile-FW) in the same folder as the LUFA directory as demonstrated in this repository. 

Compile firmware, Step 2:
Run the makefile to generate the .hex file, and then program the MCU via programmer of your choice in conjunction with avrdude. You can find a good tutorial on AVRDUDE here: http://www.ladyada.net/learn/avr/avrdude.html

Note: This makefile specifies the usbtiny programmer, if you are hoping to use a different programmer you will need to modify the makefile and change this line.
