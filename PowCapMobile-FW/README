Using this firmware, Step 1:
Ensure that LUFA is properly installed and place firmware directory (PowCapMobile-FW) in the same folder as the LUFA directory as demonstrated in this repository. Alternatively, you may specify the path to the LUFA directory by modifying line 119 in the makefile.

Compile firmware, Step 2:
"Make" to generate the .hex file, and then program the MCU via programmer of your choice in conjunction with avrdude. You can find a good tutorial on AVRDUDE here: http://www.ladyada.net/learn/avr/avrdude.html

Note: This makefile specifies the usbtiny programmer (line 351 in makefile), if you are hoping to use a different programmer you will need to modify the makefile and change this line.
