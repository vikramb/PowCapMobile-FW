Using this firmware, Step 1:
Ensure that LUFA is properly installed and place firmware directory (PowCapMobile-FW) in the same folder as the LUFA directory as demonstrated in this repository.

Run the makefile to generate the .hex file, and then program the MCU via programmer of your choice in conjunction with avrdude.
